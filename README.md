# Eva Theme for Windows Terminal  

Preview and copy themes for the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

Use the project at [windowsterminalthemes.dev](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)

## How to use the themes

This repository contains the Eva Theme for Windows Terminal, ported from the EvaTheme for VSCode. This theme is for users who enjoy the EvaTheme color scheme and want to have the same look and feel in their Windows Terminal.  
  

The [official docs for Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes) seem to very thoroughly explain how to change the settings, but essentially:
- visit the [Windows Terminal Themes website](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)
- Search and Get the Eva Dark/Eva Light on the website.
- open Windows Terminal settings
- add your chosen theme(s) to `schemes`
- in `profiles`, find the shell you're using (eg cmd, powershell, ubuntu) and replace `colorScheme` with the name of the theme
- ðŸ¥³

## Contribute a theme

Ideally for the ecosystem new themes should be proposed to [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) (where most of these themes come from), then everyone can benefit.

If not, new themes can be add added with a pull request. Just add them to the list in `app/src/custom-colour-schemes.json`. You shouldn't need to run anything. If you'd like to receive credit, or know who should, please add it to `app/src/credits.json`.

## Running

Install using `yarn` and run using `yarn start`, this should start both the React app and Express server.

You can run all the tests with `yarn test:dev`.

E2E tests are run with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). You can use `yarn cy:open` to open and develop using the Dashboard and run test suite with `yarn cy:run`. There's a few unit test using Jest that you can develop using `yarn unit:watch`.

There's CI with CircleCI and there's visual regression tests with Percy too.

### Compiling the themes

The json list is generated by the Express server in `/server`. It merges all the schemes found in the [iTerm2-Color-Schemes/windowsterminal](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/windowsterminal) using the GitHub API, then combines it with `src/custom-colour-schemes.json` in `/app`. It runs on a server with a daily cron job.

## Todo

- [x] a way to share themes
- [x] testing with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [x] automating the compilation step
- [x] improve responsiveness
- [x] add a codeblock view
- [x] nicer UI
- [x] create monorepo with [terminal-api](https://github.com/atomcorp/terminal-api)
- [x] code refactor/tidy
- [x] add theme credits into app
- [ ] use canvas for rendering the colour test

## Notes

- Most themes are copied from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) so huge thanks and credit to them and all the theme designers
- aim is to be simple and accessible, please let me know any accessibility problems!
- this project is based around: React (create-react-app), TypeScript, Github Pages, immer and CSS Grid
- the following projects were really useful [clipboard-polyfill](https://github.com/lgarron/clipboard-polyfill), [resize-observer-polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill), [file-saver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) and [get-contrast](https://github.com/johno/get-contrast) and [StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) for helping with dark mode colours and styling. Thanks!
- Icons are all [Material Design](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline), except GitHub's mark which is from [GitHub Primer](https://primer.style/octicons/)
- Terminal logo is made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>
- Indispensable logo animation help from https://codepen.io/NickNoordijk/pen/VLvxLE?editors=1010 & https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/svg-linear-gradients

## Annoyances

- `eslint` version in package.json root should be tied to version used in Create React App. See issue [Dependency Warning - proper way to implement Yarn Workspace monorepo with CRA with root dependencies](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6324)
