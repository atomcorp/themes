Preview and copy themes for the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

Use the project at [windowsterminalthemes.dev](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)

## How to use the themes

This repository contains the Eva Theme for Windows Terminal, ported from the EvaTheme for VSCode. This theme is for users who enjoy the EvaTheme color scheme and want to have the same look and feel in their Windows Terminal.  
  

The [official docs for Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes) seem to very thoroughly explain how to change the settings, but essentially:
- visit the [Windows Terminal Themes website](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)
- Search and Get the Eva Dark/Eva Light on the website.
- open Windows Terminal settings
- add your chosen theme(s) to `schemes`
- in `profiles`, find the shell you're using (eg cmd, powershell, ubuntu) and replace `colorScheme` with the name of the theme
